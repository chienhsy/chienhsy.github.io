# About
I am a PhD Candidate in the Research School of Economics at Australian National University.
My research interests are dynamic programming, economic networks, and economic computation. 
Here is my [Curriculum Vitae](/files/resume.pdf).

# Working Papers
## [Dynamic Programming with State-Action-Dependent Discounting](/files/dpsadd_v2.pdf)

In this paper, we extend the discrete-time dynamic programming to
the case of state-action-dependent discounting. We establish a sufficient condition
known as "eventual discounting" to guarantee the standard optimality results. The
condition becomes necessary for the existence of policy value when state space is
compact. Our research encompasses dynamic programming with both bounded and
unbounded rewards. Furthermore, we extend the scope of eventual discounting to
applications involving risk-sensitive preferences.

## [Temporal-Difference Learning with State-Action-Dependent Discounting](/files/Qsadd_v2.pdf)

This paper extends model-free learning algorithms, including Q-learning,
SARSA, and double Q-learning to the learning with state-action-dependent discount
factors. We allow the discount factor to be greater than one with positive probability, 
but the expected multiplicative of discount factors satisfies the "eventually
discounting" condition in the sense that we replace $β < 1$ by $ρ(L) < 1$, where $ρ(L)$
denotes the spectral radius of an appropriate matrix dominating the expected discounted future value.

## [Uniqueness of Equilibria in Interactive Networks](/files/unique_network_v2.pdf)

We study a unified network framework and show that equilibrium exists and is unique (almost surely) under either eventually contracting or non-expansive assumptions.
We also discuss the computation methods and show the necessity of boundedness conditions when interaction functions are non-expansive.
Applying the equilibrium in the study of systemic risk, we provide a measure to determine the key player who causes the most significant impact if removed from the network. 

## [Explaining Systematic Departures from Gibrat’s Law](/files/Depature_Gibrat_v2.pdf)

One of the most well-known ”laws” in economics is Gibrat’s Law of
proportionate effect. Concerning firm dynamics, Gibrat’s law predicts that firm
growth will be independent of its size. While Gibrat’s Law is frequently used as a
benchmark in models of industry dynamics, the majority of recent empirical literature demonstrates a systematic departure from Gibrat’s Law: small firms exhibit
higher volatility than larger ones. This paper aims to provide an explanation for
this systematic deviation. Utilizing a hierarchical production network, we demonstrate that upstream firms, which tend to be smaller, display more volatility than
downstream firms. The model also offers an explanation for the observation that the firm size distribution follows a power law.
